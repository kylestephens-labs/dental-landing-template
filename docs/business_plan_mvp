Business plan

#1 Executive Positioning (how you win)
	•	Category: “Local Ops OS” for SMBs.
	•	Wedge: “Website that actually answers new leads in under 5 minutes.”
	•	Differentiator vs agencies/DIY:
	•	Speed: 48-hour go-live from intake → domain → forms → alerts.
	•	Outcome over assets: SLAs on response time + booked appointments, not just “a site.”
	•	Automation factory: Prebuilt workflows (notify, follow-up, review ask, missed-call text-back).
	•	No PHI/low-risk: Intake is contact + intent only; everything else offloads to client channels.

#2 ICPs & Phasing (volume-first)

Phase 1 (MVP revenue):
	•	Home Services cluster (fast-cash): plumbers, HVAC, electricians, cleaning (you already have 500+; cleaning alone ~350).
	•	Gyms/Fitness: used to SaaS, strong no-show problem.

Phase 2 (higher ACV):
	•	Dentists (~968): appointment ops + review engine; sell as HIPAA-aware “ops layer” (no PHI).

Prioritization rule of thumb: start where volume × ops gaps (missing site/booking) × reachable owner is highest. Your dataset supports Cleaning + Plumbing/HVAC first, then Dentists.

#3 Product by Phase (base vs upsells)

Phase 1 — Base Website + Intake + Notify (MVP)

Deliverables (per client):
	•	Fast, branded landing page (hero → call or form → reviews → services).
	•	Intake form (name + phone/email + intent + time pref + consent).
	•	Supabase leads table + RLS; notifications (email/SMS) on submission.
	•	“Missed-call → text back” (optional if you add a call-tracking number).

Acceptance criteria:
	•	TTI < 2.5s mobile; CLS < 0.1; form submit < 1s; lead visible in DB; client notified < 60s.
	•	No PHI. At least one of phone/email required.
	•	Local SEO schema present; GMB/GBP link prominent.

Phase 2 — Automation Add-ons (Upsells)
	•	2-way SMS/email follow-ups (24h/72h) if client hasn’t contacted lead.
	•	Review booster: request + drip; pipe 4–5★ to Google link, <4★ to private feedback.
	•	Lead enrichment (basic business info, dedup, spam guard).
	•	CRM/Sheets sync; booking handoff to Calendly/YouCanBookMe/Google Calendar.
	•	Missed-call → text back + voicemail to text.

Phase 3 — SaaS Platform
	•	Client dashboard (multi-tenant): leads, statuses, simple analytics (speed-to-contact, show rate).
	•	Stripe billing + self-serve upgrades.
	•	AI triage (“hot/warm/cold”), smart reply templates.

#5 Go-to-Market: Outreach & Marketing

Target list

Use your Supabase “scoreboard” to pull:
	•	No website OR site with no booking/phone
	•	Review_count ≥ 10 (some trust)
	•	Cities you can service fast (East Bay first)

Multi-channel sequence (10 business days)
	1.	Day 1 – Email (owner@ / info@)
Subject: “Missed jobs from Google in {{City}}”
3 bullets: missing website/booking/phone → 48-hour fix → $750. Link to demo.
	2.	Day 2 – SMS (if public): “Quick one—saw {{Biz}} on Google. Want a ‘book-now’ page + text alerts live this week? (No contracts.) OK to send demo?”
	3.	Day 3 – Phone: 90-sec “value + ask” (book 15-min).
	4.	Day 5 – Email #2: 30-sec Loom showing their GMB + “book now” mock.
	5.	Day 7 – Postcard (optional, for home services): QR → demo domain.
	6.	Day 10 – Close: “We hold this promo slot 48 hours; after that we move to the next business.”

Assets to support:
	•	One demo domain per ICP (e.g., eastbay-dental-demo.com, eastbay-cleaning-demo.com).
	•	3× 30-sec Looms (Dentist, Cleaning, HVAC) showing “before/after” with your template.
	•	“48-hour launch checklist” PDF as a lead magnet.

Marketing flywheels:
	•	GBP optimization mini-offer ($199): fix categories, hours, services, booking link.
	•	Referral loop: $100 credit per referral.
	•	Review carousel widget on their site (free in Starter → upgrades to automate).

#6 Architecture (clean + scalable)

Now: single Supabase project; sites (one row per client) + leads (FK to site).
Tenant model: start single-tenant deploys (one Vercel project per client) for simplicity; move to multi-tenant when you hit 15–20 sites (host header → site by domain/slug).
Automation: n8n for notifications + follow-ups (start with email; add SMS next).
Data safety: PII only (name/phone/email). No diagnosis, no birthdates → out of HIPAA scope.

⸻

#7 Operations & SLAs
	•	SLA: new lead alert within 5 minutes (email; SMS under Growth).
	•	Launch: within 48 hours from deposit + logo/contact/hours.
	•	Change requests: 1 batch/month included in Starter; more in Growth/Pro.
	•	Uptime: Vercel + Supabase managed; status page link included in SOW.

Onboarding checklist (repeatable):
	1.	Create sites row (name, domain, city, contact).
	2.	Vercel project + env vars → deploy.
	3.	Form test → lead stored + notification fires.
	4.	DNS + SSL; GBP “Website”/“Appointment” links updated.
	5.	Add to CRM board (status: Live / Trial / Past-due).

⸻

#8 Metrics & Reviews
	•	Acquisition: email→call connect rate, demo-to-sale %.
	•	Activation: time-to-first-lead, % leads with response under 1 hour.
	•	Retention: churn %, average lifetime months.
	•	Expansion: upsell take-rate (% upgrading to Growth/Pro in 30/60/90 days).
	•	Outreach quality: reply rate by ICP/city, cost per meeting.

Weekly review ritual (60 min):
	•	Top of funnel (prospects/meetings).
	•	Live sites; any SLA breaches.
	•	Experiments: test 2 new subject lines, 1 Loom angle, 1 SMS opener.

⸻

#9 Risks & Mitigations
	•	Compliance drift: keep forms “contact only”; put notices (“no medical info”).
	•	Owner tech fatigue: do install-for-them (DNS, GBP, forwarding).
	•	Brittleness: standardize n8n nodes; export workflow JSON per client; use retries + dead-letter email.

⸻

#10 14-Day Launch Plan

Day 1–2: finalize templates; lock “Starter/Growth/Pro” pricing page; build 3 Looms.
Day 3–4: import priority leads (no-site / no-booking); generate mail-merge lists.
Day 5–10: run the 10-day sequence; book demos; close first 5.
Day 11–14: launch 5 sites; set review asks; create 2 case studies.

⸻
